### Triangle Word Pattern

A program that creates a triangle pattern with a given word:
- First displays the first letter
- Then the first two letters
- Continues until the full word is displayed
- Then decreases in the same pattern back to the first letter

**Example output** for the word "PYTHON":
```
P
PY
PYT
PYTH
PYTHO
PYTHON
PYTHO
PYTH
PYT
PY
P
```

**Skills demonstrated:**
- String manipulation
- For and while loops
- Error handling with try/except
- Input validation
- String slicing

**Implementation highlights:**
- Used `ascii_letters` from the `string` module for character validation
- Combined both for loops and while loops as required
- Applied proper error handling for invalid inputs

## Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress learning Python programming concepts. Each challenge focuses on specific programming techniques that build my skills systematically.

### Core concepts I'm exploring:

- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- String manipulation
- Error handling
- Functions and modularity
- Algorithm development

## Future Plans

I'm continuously adding new challenges to this repository as I learn. Future additions will include more complex concepts such as:

- File handling
- Object-oriented programming
- Working with external libraries
- API integration
- Data analysis

## Connect With Me

I'm always looking to connect with other learners and developers. Feel free to reach out or contribute to this repository!
